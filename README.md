## Digital Waveform Graph ##

**Digital Waveform Graph** transforms channel so that it will plot on a Digital Waveform Chart.  A channel is made into an array of booleans based upon a threshold value and then displayed.  This graph is similar to the Digital Waveform Chart in LabVIEW, but with some limited functionality.
